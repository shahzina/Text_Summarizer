## creating a query based text summarizer after the text rank algorithm
##pseudocode
	## how to input query
	## how to extract keywords from input
	## what metric to choose from to compare similarity of input and output keywords
	## try encoder decoder model
	## use different datasets to make the code more robust. 

query = input("User input: ")

## for text rank you use a similarity matrix between sentences
## what sort of a similarity matrix do use for text and query??
